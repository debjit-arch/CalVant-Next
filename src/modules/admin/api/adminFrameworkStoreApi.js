/**
 * adminFrameworkStoreApi.js
 *
 * Support calls for the "Buy a Framework" feature on Manage Subscription
 * (see BuyFrameworkModal.jsx). This is deliberately a NEW, separate file
 * rather than additions to adminBillingApi.js — that file's header notes its
 * exports are a stable contract consumed by name, and everything here talks
 * to user-service / framework-service, not billing-service.
 *
 * Nothing here is a new backend endpoint. Every call below hits an endpoint
 * that already exists and is already used elsewhere in this codebase:
 *   - GET   /api/organizations/{id}            — OrganizationController (existing)
 *   - PATCH /api/organizations/{id}/settings    — OrganizationController (existing);
 *     same endpoint that presumably backs a future org "Compliance Settings"
 *     frameworks editor. We only ever send `{ frameworks }` in the body, so
 *     tprmEnabled and every other org field is left exactly as-is
 *     (OrganizationController only touches a field when it's present in the
 *     request body).
 *   - GET   https://api.calvant.com/framework/api/frameworks — the framework
 *     library (same URL FrameworkContex's frameworkService.js already calls),
 *     just fetched through adminAxios instead of a raw fetch() so the auth
 *     token is attached the same way every other admin call attaches it.
 *
 * adminAxios's baseURL is https://api.calvant.com/user-service/api, so the
 * organizations calls below use relative paths; the framework-library call
 * passes an absolute URL, which axios uses as-is in place of baseURL.

 * *displayed* (it's a real framework) but is not yet something the backend
 * will let an org actually select via PATCH /organizations/{id}/settings —
